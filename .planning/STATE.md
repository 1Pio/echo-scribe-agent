Current phase: Phase 1 - Foundation
Last activity: 2026-02-11 - Completed quick task 1: Create the first init commit for the new public GitHub repo, verify .gitignore readiness, preserve the existing MIT LICENSE created on GitHub, and push the full current codebase cleanly to https://github.com/1Pio/echo-scribe-agent.git

### Active Work

- Quick task 1 completed: repository baseline established and pushed to `origin/main`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- None currently.

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
|---|-------------|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Create the first init commit for the new public GitHub repo, verify .gitignore readiness, preserve the existing MIT LICENSE created on GitHub, and push the full current codebase cleanly to https://github.com/1Pio/echo-scribe-agent.git | 2026-02-11 | 8cb12f3 | [1-create-the-first-init-commit-for-the-new](./quick/1-create-the-first-init-commit-for-the-new/) |

### Decisions

- Initialized a standalone git repository in `livekit-agent` to avoid inheriting unrelated parent repository history.
- Merged remote `origin/main` (unrelated history) to preserve GitHub-created MIT license lineage before push.

### Completed Quick Plans

- `quick-1-create-the-first-init-commit-for-the-new/1-PLAN.md` completed on 2026-02-11.
