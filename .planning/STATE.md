# STATE

Current phase: Phase 1 - Foundation
Last activity: 2026-02-11 - Completed quick task 1 repository bootstrap and remote push.

### Active Work

- Quick task 1 completed: repository baseline established and pushed to `origin/main`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- None currently.

### Decisions

- Initialized a standalone git repository in `livekit-agent` to avoid inheriting unrelated parent repository history.
- Merged remote `origin/main` (unrelated history) to preserve GitHub-created MIT license lineage before push.

### Completed Quick Plans

- `quick-1-create-the-first-init-commit-for-the-new/1-PLAN.md` completed on 2026-02-11.
